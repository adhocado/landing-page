              Either you run the day or the day runs you. Unfortunately, most of
              us fall into the latter category. We are at the mercy of our busy
              schedules, making it hard for us to find a common time to meet
              each other. <br />
              <br /> Take a breather. We are here to help.

          <p>
            As fellow Gen Zs struggling to find time to meet our friends amidst
            our busy schedules, we set out to develop a calendar that
            automatically recommends the timings when everyone can meet. <br />
            <br />
            We travelled 14,991 km and spent 10000 hours in two different
            countries to expand our technical skills and market insights. We
            interviewed over 500 people (and still counting) to discern each and
            everyoneâ€™s ideal calendar app. Just like how time never stops for
            us, we never stop for you.
